I earned my Ph.D. degree at Boston College under the mentorship of Prof. Ying Ran. My research is primarily focused on exploring the intricate emergent phenomena in strongly-correlated systems, with a particular emphasis on the interplay of symmetry and topology in moire system, particularly twisted transition metal dichalcognides (tTMD). Both analytic methods and numerical tools are used in my reasearch. Outside of physics, I like to play the board game Go, go hiking, and self-learn programming techniques and abstract mathematics. ",

    "content": "We have formulated a systematic projective construction for fractional Chern Insulators (FCI). Interestingly, the electronic states obtained from projection of composite-fermion states recovers Jain’s famous wave function in traditional Galilean-invariant Landau levels, but turns out to be different in general, revealing instead a mathematical object known as the Combinatorial Hyperdeterminants. Benchmark of our states and Jain/Laughlin’s states with the exact diagonalization (ED) clearly demonstrate the superiority of our approach for studying FCI, where both translation and rotation symmetries are discrete. Most notably, after a composite-fermion level Hartree-Fock mean-field optimization (rather than an electronic optimization), we found that the overlaps between our hyperdeterminant states and those obtained from ED consistently outperform those of Jain/Laughlin’s states across the entire parameter space! .
