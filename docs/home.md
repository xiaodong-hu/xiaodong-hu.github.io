## About Me
I am now pursuing a Ph.D in theoretical condensed matter physics at Boston Collge, working with Prof. Ying Ran. My research interests lies in the rich emergent phenomenon of strongly-correlated systems, particularly when symmetries and topology come into play, like fractional quantum Hall systems and high-Tc superconductivitors. Both analytic methods and numeric tools are used in my research.

Outside of physics, I like to play the board game Go, go hiking, and self-learn programming techniques and abstract mathematics.



## Recent Highlights
We develop a systematic projective construction to obtain the strongly-correlated electronic states from the (almost non-interacting) composite-fermion states.

todo!
