title: Effecive Field Theory of the EM Response of FQHE Systems
parent: Notes

D.T. Son develop the **non-relativistic general coordinate transformations** for Galilean-invariant system under EM in a curved spacetime, and propose a systematic EFT. The resulting EM response includes not only the normal quantized Hall response, but also the intriguing Hall viscosity, providing an experimental proposal to measure the Hall viscosity
