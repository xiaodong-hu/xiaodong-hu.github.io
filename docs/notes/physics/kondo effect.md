This note give detailed calculation on
- what's the low-energy description of the ferromagnetic impurities to itinerate electrons? --- the famous **s-d model**
- how to explain the lifting tail of the $\rho$-$T$ curve in low temperature? --- spin-flip scatterings give logarithmic correction
- Such logarithmic correction brings in an even more serious problem in the limit $T\rightarrow0$K: : the resistivity of dopped alloys now will divergence!. SO how to reconcile this puzzle? --- **Anderson's pool man scaling**
