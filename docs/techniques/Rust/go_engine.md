I am trying to develop a go engine in rust. My goal is to develop a low-energy effective description of Go, for examply by search for the effective Hamiltonian, rather than simply implementing the brute-force RNN network, without any understanding of the trainning result.

The progress can be found in my repo [rotax (.py and .rs)](https://github.com/xiaodong-hu/rotax)
